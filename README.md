# Cyber Shadows
**Analyzing the Correlation Between Cyber Attacks and National Events**

This project explores the dynamics of cyber attacks and their correlation with geopolitical events, using sophisticated data analysis techniques to predict cyber threats and assess national transparency in cyber incident reporting. 
The repository provides access to all the methodologies, code, and data used in the study, ensuring full replicability and transparency of the research process.

## Project Overview
The project utilizes synthetic data from Kaggle and real-world event records from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) to analyze the patterns and implications of cyber attacks in relation to global events. 
The core objectives include:
- Mapping cyber battlegrounds via IP address translation.
- Applying the PageRank algorithm to evaluate the prominence of nations within the cyber conflict network.
- Developing a predictive model using link prediction techniques.
- Assessing the transparency of national cyber incident reporting through GDELTDoc analysis.
